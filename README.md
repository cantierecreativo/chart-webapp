# Chart Web App

This application allows you to upload a CSV file and use it as a data source for a series of graphs.

## Stack

The stack is React + Typescript and uses Vite as a bundler.
I used Yarn as package manager

## Run locally

The first time, you have to install the dependencies

```zsh
yarn install
```

So you're ready to run with the command:

```zsh
yarn dev
```

your app is running on port `http://localhost:3000`
